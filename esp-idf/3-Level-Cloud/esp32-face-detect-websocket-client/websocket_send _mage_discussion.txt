There were several and persistent recv_udp errors at the first implementations. THe errors were indentified as the low-level networking stack getting corrupted. 
the verdict was that the server cannot effectively handle 150KB size frames from the client as one chunk.

The client is trying to send the entire image at once. The server's networking buffers cannot handle such a size single incoming packet, so it corrupts the LwIP networking stack and causes crashes before any other code even runs!

The only solution is to force the client to send the large frame fragmented
1. Client Fix: Implement Frame Fragmentation
The most important change is to modify the client so it no longer sends a single,  150KB packet. Instead, it will break the image into 4KB parts and send them as a  fragmented WebSocket message. It seems a better way to handle large payloads.
