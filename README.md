# IoT-Embedded

Collection of **IoT and embedded systems projects**. Ther is code for both **Arduino** and **Espressif ESP-IDF**. Some initial and basic parts of the projects are taken form code provided by Espressif. Some discussion readme files are created by AI, use with caution.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

## üîç Basics
- **Arduino ESP32 Projects** ‚Üí Sketches, hardware interfacing, and libraries. They are fully functional, dont forget to enable the correct libraries and modules.
- **ESP-IDF Projects** ‚Üí Firmware, network connections, mqtt, etc. Specific hardware enabled (e.g., ESP32-CAM, ESP32-S3, ESP-S3-WROOM-1).
